      <h1>About My Music</h1>
      <article>
        <p>Dietrich Strause owns one of the finer collections of songs on the Boston music scene. Strause’s creations come at you first with their simple charm, a lot of which resides in his gentle persona and friendly attitude. It’s hard not to like this kid. And this kid is as mature and tested as any of his local songwriting elders.</p><p> His first gigs were as a trumpet player at biker bars in central Pennsylvania. He was only 15. He moved to Boston after attending Oberlin College four years ago because there was extra room in the van when he was helping his friend move into law school. He’s worked as a dog-walker, a subject in medical research studies, and records music for Chinese textbooks. All of this comes out in his own music, which is a comfortable and careful mix of real journeys, clever literary references, and striking imagery.</p><p> You can tell he’s grateful for his skills as a songwriter. With two full-length albums in less than three years, he’s certainly embraced it. Strause’s songs are versatile—personal, but universal enough to hook the masses. He is currently working on his third full length album with his live band and frequent collaborators; an outfit of some of the Boston area’s finest musicians, who have toured and recorded with Josh Ritter, Patty Griffin, and Ray Lamontagne. He has shared the stage with artists such as The David Wax Museum, Ben Sollee, and Brown Bird.</p>
